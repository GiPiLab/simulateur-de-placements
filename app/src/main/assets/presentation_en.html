The investment simulator designed by the <a href="https://gipilab.org">Laboratoire de Recherche pour
    le Dévelopemment Local</a> facilitates making any investment decision.
Just as a borrowing, of which it is the symmetry, an investment can be defined, as an object, as the
framework in which a set of parameters falls:

<ul>
    <li>A excedent of cash, ascertained by a natural or legal person (the holder), in the light of
        unassigned capital in the short, medium or long term or the recurrence of a flow of money
        likely to be of the same type of capital
    </li>
    <li>A rate which always corresponds to a percentage applied to the invested part of the capital
        to form the interest, or the transaction value of the money, as raw material, negotiated in
        exchange for the holder's surplus cash
    </li>
    <li>A period, during which the profitability of the investment is implemented</li>
    <li>An end, characterized by the disruption of the investment (withdrawal) and the realization
        of the expected profitability
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Main Features</h2>

<h4>Display of answers in the form of an investment table:</h4>

Instead of providing a response of the type: how much interest will I get if I put [sum] for [t] to
[%] = [reply], the investment simulator proposes a table containing the periodic distribution of [ ]
over the entire duration of the investment.

<h4>Monthly or bi-monthly breakdown of acquired profitability:</h4>

The investment table, counterpart amortization schedule established for a loan, allows to know the
amount of interest accrued at the end of each period, depending on whether the investment is made

<h4>Payments or withdrawals:</h4>

The simulator distinguishes between original and invested capital and prohibits periodic withdrawals
with a forecast sum greater than the original capital.

<h4>Graphical comparisons:</h4>

A graphical tool makes it possible to compare several investments to anticipate the best
profitability given initial parameters likely to influence the decision to the wrong choice.


<h2>Privacy</h2>
The investment simulator does not collect any personal data, the simulations that the user performs remain on his device. The simulator is, as the name implies, a <b>simulator</b>. It is not
affiliated to any banking organization, it does not offer any real investment. The user remains fully responsible for how he manages his money.
